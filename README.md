You will need Python installed on your system.
I downloaded it for Windows from here:
https://www.python.org/downloads/
Load a command prompt and try:
`python --version`
if it shows some form of an error, Python isn't installed sufficiently.

To install required external packages, run
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
