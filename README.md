You will need Python installed on your system.  
I downloaded it for Windows from here:  
https://www.python.org/downloads/  
Load a command prompt and try:  
`python --version`  
if it shows some form of an error, Python isn't installed sufficiently.  
  
To install required external packages, run  
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`  
  
Then to extract your mods:  
`python mod_extractor.py username path`  
Where username is your swgoh.gg username and path is where you want your file to be outputted to.
